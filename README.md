# EncryptedBulletinBoard

For this application to work, PostgreSQL should be using the following configurations:
  1: PostgreSQL should be running on the port 5432 along with this application.
  2: Create database "bulletin_board"
  3: Create a user "db_user" and password "password"
Any changes in these settings need to be updated in the application.properties file
